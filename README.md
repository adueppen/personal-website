Currently my site tries to get you to leave as soon as possible, so hopefully that's something I can avoid this time.
I'm using [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) for this. Please be aware that this site will be subject to sudden breaking 
changes for the time being.

[contact me](mailto:contact@ajd.sh) and we can discuss.  

- Considering the personal nature of this site, I don't want to release the entire thing under a highly permissive
license. I'm fine with small parts of this site being used for other projects, but please don't copy the entire thing.

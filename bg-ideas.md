# Stuff to consider for site background animation
- maze generation
  - maybe it could be on a triangular grid instead of square to match with my logo better? if so I would need to have some rounded corners which could be tricky
- if not maze generation, at least some sort of random path generation. it would be nice to have something like [this](https://codepen.io/juliangarnier/pen/ZeEpgd) but have the lines actually randomly generated instead of just being a static file animated. additionally it would probably be better to have there be fewer, thicker lines in a color that doesn't stand out **too** much.
  - it could be interesting to have essentially a variety of paths going diagonally, turning in random directions but overall going towards the opposite direction. I'll have to make a sketch tomorrow.
- some sort of cellular automaton could be cool, but I would want to do something other than conway's game of life because
  1. it's already pretty common
  2. I don't want to rip of James's site _too_ much
  - perhaps some sort of cellular automaton based on a hexagonal/triangular grid? triangular grid _would_ go pretty well with my whole logo thingy

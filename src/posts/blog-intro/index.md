It's been a while, huh? The last time I made any real changes to this site was 
[exactly 2 years ago today](https://github.com/adueppen/personal-website/commit/543c4d6). A lot has changed since then,
so I think it makes sense to go over that before I get into more details about this blog. 

### What even were the last 2 years?
On April 3, 2020, things were pretty different, to say the least. After 4 months of working in my first office job, I
was adjusting to the idea of remote work. At this point, it still seemed like a return to the office was only weeks
away, so I hadn't exactly been getting too settled into my new work style. These days, however, I'm hardly even
considering returning to the office. On one hand, being able to use my own computer for much of my work has without a
doubt helped me to be more productive, and I definitely appreciate being able to wake up later than I had been
previously. 

Not all of this has been a positive change though, as on the other hand, this increased productivity has come at the
expense of my personal/hobby projects. Commuting to and from the office every day did provide a good separation between
my work life and my personal life, and I also miss encountering both familiar and unfamiliar people on the bus each day
as well as the varied social interactions that are only really possible in a physical office.

If I had to sum up my life in these past 2 years as briefly as possible, 2020 is the year where everything changed, 2021
is the year where I got stuck in a rut, and 2022 is the year where I get out of it. One of the primary goals I set for
myself at the beginning of the year was to improve my work-life balance, get out of the bad habits I had gotten myself
into in the last year, and to get back into the hobby projects that had helped me get here in the first place. I'll also
be heading off to college in the fall, where I'm planning to major in Computer Engineering at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

I may be being a bit hard on 2021 though, as it is also the year that I acquired a number of new friends and new
hobbies, the most significant one being my newfound interest in typewriters. One of the first things that caught my eye
while going through my paternal grandfather's things after his passing in early 2021 was his electronic typewriter. I've
long been interested in vintage technology (particularly from the 1980s) and mechanical keyboards, yet electronic
typewriters weren't something I had ever really encountered before despite often being examples of both. However, I
quickly found that it was a very enjoyable way to write, and allowed me to get my thoughts out much more easily than on
paper or on a computer. The relative obscurity of these machines as well as their easy availability on sites like eBay
has led me to acquire somewhat of a collection, and so they will certainly feature in future posts on this blog.
Speaking of which...

### What's with this whole blog thing?
I had intended to start writing blog posts a while back, but the aforementioned work-life balance issues have led to
nothing coming to fruition yet. With the number of things that have changed in the past 2 years though, there's really
no better time to start on it than now! I have a lot of things floating around my head that I'm interested in writing
about, but the main areas of focus here are most likely going to be:

- Programming
  - This will mostly revolve around my experiences trying out new libraries and languages, although I'll also work on
    some more tutorial-type posts that will be published on [Unicorn Utterances](https://unicorn-utterances.com), a site
    I contribute to, and linked here.
- Vintage technology
  - My primary interest at the moment is in daisy-wheel printing, which involves both typewriters and computer printers
    (and a few that can be both, which will surely be featured on here as well).
  - More recently, I've been messing around with a Canon Typestar 7 thermal typewriter, so that'll most likely be the
    topic of my next post.
- Public transit
  - I gained an interest in public transit in the summer of 2019, and from late 2019 until March 2020, I was regularly
    riding the local bus system. There are a lot of ways that transit in my area could be improved, so I may write some
    posts about that.
